Our community aspires to treat everyone equally and to value all contributions. 
We have a Code of Conduct to foster an open and welcoming environment.


:::{admonition} Why should I read the contributing guidelines?
:class: tip
As most of us have surely experienced, 
maintaining a free and open-source project is not a trivial task,
and the need for coordination between different contributors who 
are not all in contact with each other adds another layer of complexity to the job.
To value every volunteer's time and efforts, we have devised detailed instructions
for how to join the conversation and become a part of the community.
These guidelines aim to standardize the development and maintenance process,
so that a large portion of the pipeline can be automated. 
By following these instructions, you ensure that you and every other member
is making the most out of their time and efforts.

If you are new to contributing to open-source projects,
we also recommend reading the [Open Source Guides](https://opensource.guide),
particularly: [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/).


## Become a Collaborator
* writing code; fixing bugs, improving performance and quality, and adding new features
* adding examples and tutorials to the documentation
* proofreading, editing and writing documentation


It starts by describing the [general development cycle](./general.md) of the project,
followed by detailed instructions for different types of contributions.
If you are interested in becoming an active member or a maintainer of the project,
we strongly advise you to read all sections chronologically. Otherwise,
you can read the [general notes](./general.md) and then
head down to the section addressing the type of contribution you want to make
(see left sidebar), for example [reporting a problem](./report-problem.md) or
[contributing code](collaborate/dev-guide/index.md).
