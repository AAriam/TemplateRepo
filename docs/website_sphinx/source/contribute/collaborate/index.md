## Become a Collaborator
* writing code; fixing bugs, improving performance and quality, and adding new features
* adding examples and tutorials to the documentation
* proofreading, editing and writing documentation


It starts by describing the [general development cycle](./general.md) of the project,
followed by detailed instructions for different types of contributions.
If you are interested in becoming an active member or a maintainer of the project,
we strongly advise you to read all sections chronologically. Otherwise,
you can read the [general notes](./general.md) and then
head down to the section addressing the type of contribution you want to make
(see left sidebar), for example [reporting a problem](./report-problem.md) or
[contributing code](collaborate/dev-guide/index.md).
