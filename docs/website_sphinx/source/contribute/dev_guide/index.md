## General Procedure

Every change in the repository starts with [creating an issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue).

When you are assigned to an issue

1. If you are not a core developer of the project (and thus don't have write access to this repository),
[fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository first.
2. On your fork (or on this repository when you are a core developer),
create a new branch from the **main** branch
