# Navigating the Website

(help-website-login)=
## Login
To improve the documentation, all links referencing the different parts
of a |{{ ccc.name }}| repository can be dynamically updated to point to your repository.
To do this, click on the <button class="user-login-button btn btn-sm inline_icon pst-js-only" title="Login" aria-label="Login">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-user-gear fa-lg"></i>
</button> icon and enter your GitHub repository full name.
This icon is part of the website's navigation bar, which is located at the top-right corner of the page
on large screens, and in the menu on small screens.


## Copying Code Blocks

:::{tip}
You can simply copy the contents of each presented code/command block in this documentation
(like the one below), by hovering your mouse over that block, and clicking on the copy button
that appears on the right side of the block.
