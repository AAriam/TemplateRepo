## Login
To improve the documentation, all links referencing the different parts
of a |{{ ccc.name }}| repository can be dynamically updated to point to your repository.
To do this, click on the <button class="user-login-button btn btn-sm inline_icon pst-js-only" title="Login" aria-label="Login">
  <i class="fa-solid fa-user-gear fa-lg"></i>
</button> icon and enter your GitHub repository full name.
This icon is part of the website's navigation bar, which is located at the top-right corner of the page
on large screens, and in the menu on small screens.
