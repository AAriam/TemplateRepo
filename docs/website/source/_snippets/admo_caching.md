:::{admonition} Caching
:class: seealso

To speed up the processing of your repository's control center,
{{ccc.name}} can cache the retrieved data on local devices and on the GitHub servers,
so that they don't need to be fetched every time. See [Caching](#manual-control-caching)
for more information.
