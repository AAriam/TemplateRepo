# Documentation


Furthermore, all community health files (e.g. contribution guidelines, code of conduct,
support guidelines, security policy, etc.), license files, and directory README files are also
dynamically generated and updated according to the templates defined in the control center.
They include dynamic references to various information defined in your control center,
such as the name of the project, owner and copyright information, contact information,
list of maintainers, links to additional information on your website, and so on.


Similarly, changelogs and release notes, which are automatically generated and updated according
to the templates defined in the control center, also use a variety of dynamic references,
such as package version, release date, commit hash, link to the corresponding pull request,
dependency and requirement changes, list of contributors, and of course, the details of applied changes.
These are all dynamically obtained from various contexts, so that complete changelog entries and
release notes can be automatically generated and added to your repository and website
upon merging a pull request into a release branch.
