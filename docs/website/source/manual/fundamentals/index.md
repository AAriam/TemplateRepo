This section provides a comprehensive overview of all fundamental aspects of {{ pp_meta.name }},
its features and capabilities, and how they work under the hood.
You do not need to know all the information in this section to use {{ pp_meta.name }},
especially if you are just getting started with a new project,
and do not have specific needs that require a high degree of customization,
so that you are content with {{ pp_meta.name }}'s default settings and behavior.
However, as your project grows, or if you already have an existing project that you want to integrate
{{ pp_meta.name }} into, reading this guide will give you a much deeper understanding of
{{ pp_meta.name }}'s capabilities and inner workings,
allowing you to fully leverage its features and functionalities for your specific needs.
In any case, we recommend that you at least skim through this section
before starting to use {{ pp_meta.name }} in your new or existing project,
so that you have a general idea of how it works and what to expect from it.
