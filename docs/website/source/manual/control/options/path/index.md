# Paths


{{ pp_meta.custom.meta[docname].tabs }}

From the seven [main directories](/manual/fundamentals/structure/index.md) that {{pp_meta.name}}
recognizes and works with, the [GitHub directory](/manual/fundamentals/structure/github.md)
and the [Docs directory](/manual/fundamentals/structure/docs.md) have fixed paths
according to GitHub requirements, while the path to the other five directories can be customized.
As discussed before,
[Customizing the path to the control center directory](/manual/control/structure/index.md#location)
requires a configuration file outside the control center directory.
The path to the remaining four directories,
i.e., the [source](/manual/fundamentals/structure/source.md),
[tests](/manual/fundamentals/structure/tests.md),
[website](/manual/fundamentals/structure/website.md), and
[local](/manual/fundamentals/structure/local.md) directories,
along with the paths to subdirectories of the local directory,
can be customized using the `{{ pp_meta.custom.meta[docname].path }}` file
in your repository's control center, as described in this section.



Notice that these changes are not applied automatically, meaning that you must manually
rename the directories and update the corresponding paths in the `meta` content in the same commit.
Also, all directories must be orthogonal to each other, meaning that none of them can be a subdirectory
of another.



All other paths can be configured in the `path.yaml` file located at the root of the `meta` directory.
The file must contain an object with a single key `dir`.
Within the `dir` object, you can define alternative paths for the `source` directory,
`tests` directory, `website` directory, and the `local` directory and its subdirectories.
You can also add other custom keys under `dir.local.cache` and `dir.local.report`
for other tools that you use, and reference them in the corresponding configuration files.
When no `path.yaml` file is present, {{pp_meta.name}} will use the following default values:

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: ðŸ—‚ `./.meta/path.yaml`

:::

Note that you do not have to specify all keys in the `path.yaml` file.
For example, if you only want to change the name of the `source` directory and the `cache` directory,
this is how your `path.yaml` file should look like:

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: ðŸ—‚ `./.meta/path.yaml`
dir:
  source: my_source_directory
  local:
    cache:
      root: my_cache_directory
