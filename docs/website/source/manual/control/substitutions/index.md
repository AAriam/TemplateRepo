# Substitutions

To eliminate any redundancy and provide your project with a high degree of flexibility
and customization, {{ pp_meta.name }} allows for complex and recursive templating
within the entire control center, meaning that you can reference and reuse
any part of the control center's contents in all other places within the control center.

:::{admonition} Substitutions in Website Content

The entire content of the control center is also made available to your documentation website,
and can be used for substitutions in your website's content.
See [Usage > Website > Substitutions](../../usage/website/substitutions.md) for more information.
