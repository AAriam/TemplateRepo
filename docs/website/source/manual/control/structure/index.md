# Structure

The control center directory contains
declarative configurations in data files,
along with optional Python modules to dynamically
generate custom configurations and files during runtime.


## Data Files

All project configurations are stored in YAML files
within the control center directory.

::::{admonition} YAML Data File Format
:class: note dropdown
:name: yaml-intro

YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a concise and human-readable data serialization language
commonly used for configuration files,
similar to JSON and TOML formats.
YAML provides 3 main data types: mappings, sequences, and scalars.
Scalars represent single values and include strings, numbers, booleans, and null values.
Sequences and mappings on the other hand are complex data types that can contain other data types.
Sequences (aka lists, arrays) are ordered lists of items, while mappings (aka dictionaries, hash tables)
represent key-value pairs. Each YAML file contains a single top-level data structure,
which can be any of the mentioned data types.
For example, a YAML file can contain a single string,
and thus act as a plain text file:

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: YAML file with a single-line string

'Greetings from within a YAML file!'
:::

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: YAML file with a multi-line string

|
  Greetings from within a YAML file!
  YAML uses syntactically significant newlines and indentation like Python
  to represent complex data structures in a human-readable format.
  The pipe character (|) is used to denote the start of a multi-line string,
  which can span multiple lines without the need for explicit line breaks
  or quotation marks.
:::

It becomes more interesting when the top-level data type is a mapping or a sequence,
allowing for complex and nested data structures.
Sequences can be created either using dashes (`-`) or square brackets (`[]`).
For example, the following YAML file defines a sequence of mixed data types
using the dash notation (notice the use of `#` for comments):

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: YAML file with a sequence of mixed data types

- This is the first item in the sequence. It is a string.  # and this is a comment!
- 42             # The second item in the sequence, which is an integer.
- 3.14159265359  # Look, it's œÄ in the third place!
- true           # A boolean value as the fourth item.
- null           # This item is a null (aka None).
- [1, 2, 3]      # A nested sequence using square brackets.
- - One          # A nested sequence using dashes.
  - Two
  - Three
:::

Finally, mappings are created using colon (`:`) or curly braces (`{}`):

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: YAML file with a mapping as the top-level data structure

key1: value1     # A simple key-value pair; both key and value are strings.
key2: true       # he key is a string and its value is a boolean.
true: 1          # The key is a boolean and the value is an integer.
my-dashed-list:  # A key with a nested sequence as its value.
  - One
  - Two
  - Three
my-inline-list: [1, 2, 3]
my-inline-map: {key1: value1, key2: value2}
my_nested_map:
  key1: value1
  key2: value2
  key3: value3
:::

YAML also provides several advanced features such as anchors and tags
to enhance its flexibility and reusability.
[Anchors](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#3222-anchors-and-aliases)
allow you to define a value once and reference it later using aliases,
which can significantly reduce duplication and improve maintainability of large configurations.
For example, the following YAML file defines a mapping
named `my-default-settings`, anchors it to the alias `default`,
and uses that alias to reuse the mapping in two different places:

:::{code-block} yaml
:caption: YAML file with anchors and aliases

my-default-settings: &default  # The '&' character is used
  key1: value1                 # to define an anchor named 'default'
  key2: value2                 # for the `my-default-settings` mapping.

my-cases:
  - name: case1
    settings: *default         # The '*' character is used to reference the anchor.
  - name: case2
    settings: *default         # Both cases reference the same settings.
:::

[Tags](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#tags) allow you to explicitly define the datatype of a node
or apply custom semantics to the content.
For instance, a tag like `!str` can be used to specify
that a value should be treated as a string.
|{{ ccc.name }}| uses this feature to allow for
[referencing values from external sources](#cc-inheritance).

full specification at [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/).
::::

The entire project configuration is essentially a large mapping
(equivalent to a JSON object or a Python dictionary)
where some keys have simple scalar values (strings, numbers, booleans),
while others have complex nested structures (sequences and mappings).
By default, this mapping is broken down into multiple YAML files,
each containing a thematically related subset of the project configurations:

You can hover over the file names to see their descriptions,
and click on them to open the corresponding file
in your repository (needs [logging in](#help-website-login) to our website).
Note that only the most essential configurations are provided in the default configuration files.
For a full reference of all available options you can set,
see the [API reference](#api).

{#cc-file-structure}
You are completely free to restructure your configurations in any way you like.
For example, you can have a single large YAML file with all configurations,
or you can further break down the configurations into more files and subdirectories.
You can even break down a single complex value (i.e., a mapping or a sequence)
into multiple files, each containing a subset of the value's data.
When processing the control center, |{{ ccc.name }}| will automatically merge all configurations
into a single mapping using the following logic:

1. The control center directory is recursively scanned
   (excluding the [`hooks`](#manual-control-structure-hooks) subdirectory),
   and all files with a `.yaml` or `.yml` extension (case-insensitive)
   are gathered as configuration files. Each file must represent a mapping.
2. All key-value pairs from the collected files are recursively merged
   into a single mapping, where the values for the same path from different files
   are combined according to the following rules:

   - Mapping key-value pairs are combined. If two mappings share some keys,
     the values are recursively merged according to the same rules.
   - Sequences are concatenated.
     Note that files are always read in a shallow-first alphabetical order,
     so the order of concatenated sequences in the final mapping
     is determined by the order of the files.
   - Scalar values cannot be merged;
     if a scalar value is defined in multiple files,
     an error is raised and the conflicting paths are reported.
   - Mixed types (e.g., a sequence and a mapping) are not allowed at the same path;
     if such a conflict is detected, an error is raised and the conflicting paths are reported.

### Configuration Paths

We use [JSONPath](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc9535) path expressions
to refer to a specific configuration value's location in the control center.

:::{admonition} JSONPath Syntax
:class: note dropdown

JSONPath is a query language that defines a string syntax
for selecting a subset of a data structure.
It was originally designed for JSON data,
but can also be used with other data serialization formats like YAML.
In JSONPath, the root of the data structure
(in our case, the control center's top-level mapping)
is represented by the `$` symbol,
mapping keys are accessed using the dot (`.`) notation,
and sequences are accessed using square brackets (`[]`) with an index.

For example, the path expression `$.l1-key.l2-key[0]`
means that the top-level data structure is a mapping,
it has a key named `l1-key` whose value is also a mapping,
with a key named `l2-key` whose value is a sequence,
and we are referring to the first element (index 0) of that sequence.

Wildcards can also be used in path expressions using the `*` symbol,
to match any key or index at a specific level.
For example, `$[*].l2-key` means that the root data structure is a sequence
of mappings, and we are referring to the value of the key `l2-key` in each mapping.
:::

For example, you can set the name of your project at [`$.name`](#ccc-name),
i.e., as the value of the `name` key in the top-level mapping of the control center.
In which control center YAML file this key is defined (if at all) is completely up to you,
as explained [above](#cc-file-structure).


(manual-control-structure-hooks)=
## Hooks Directory

In addition to YAML files,
you can also include Python modules in the control center directory.
These act as hooks to [dynamically generate custom configurations and files](#cc-hooks)
during control center synchronization events.
They must be added to a subdirectory named `hooks`
at the root of the control center directory.
For each type of hook, |{{ ccc.name }}| looks for a specific file in this directory.
Before running your hooks, |{{ ccc.name }}| will also look for a `requirements.txt` file
in the `hooks` directory, and will install the specified packages using `pip` if found.
Note that in contrast to the YAML files,
the `hooks` directory and its constituent files
must be exactly named and located as described here.
However, beside the requirements and hook files,
you are free to add any other additional files or subdirectories to the `hooks` directory.
For example, if you want to implement multiple complex hooks,
you can modularize your code by creating a Python package in the `hooks` directory,
adding it to your `hooks/requirements.txt` file,
and importing it in your hook files.
