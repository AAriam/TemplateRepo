# Control Center



Any change applied to the control center is automatically propagated throughout your repository,
Python package, test suite, documentation website, and all other supported tools and external services.
Therefore, instead of having to deal with multiple interfaces and diverse configuration
and metadata files scattered across your repository and each with its own format and syntax,
you can simply manage your entire project from within the control center,
using a single, unified, and consistent interface;
|{{ ccc.name }}| automatically translates your changes into the appropriate formats,
generates all necessary files in the required locations, and updates them dynamically.


Therefore, besides your source code, unit tests, and documentation content,
all other aspects of your project are automatically managed by |{{ ccc.name }}| according to your specifications
in the `meta` directory.
