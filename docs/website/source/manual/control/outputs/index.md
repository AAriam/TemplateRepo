|{{ ccc.name }}| gathers all the contents of your repository's control center into a single JSON file,
which is automatically updated whenever you apply changes to the control center.
This file, which is located at `.github/control/.metadata.json`, serves two main purposes:
- During workflow runs triggered by events that do not modify the contents of the control center,
  |{{ ccc.name }}| uses this file to read all the necessary data and configurations,
  instead of unnecessarily parsing and processing the control center's contents from scratch.
- It is made available to your documentation website, allowing you to use all available data and configurations
  in your website's content and templates, without any required intervention from |{{ ccc.name }}|.

  
  


:::{admonition} Dynamic Files
:class: important

These are all dynamic files, meaning that |{{ ccc.name }}| will automatically
update them whenever you apply changes to the corresponding options in your control center.
Therefore, you should never manually edit these files, as your changes will be overwritten
by |{{ ccc.name }}| the next time they are updated. Instead, you should always
apply your changes to the corresponding options in the control center.
