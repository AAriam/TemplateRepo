{{ pp_meta.name }} is provided as a
[GitHub template repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-template-repository),
and uses [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
to automate the entire development and maintenance process of your project.
When you [create a new repository from the {{ pp_meta.name }} template](#../manual/getting-started/new-repo.md),
or [integrate {{ pp_meta.name }} into your existing repository](#../manual/getting-started/existing-repo.md),
fully configured [GitHub Actions workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows)
are added to your repository,
which will automatically run GitHub Actions every time a supported event occurs in your repository.
These workflows use {{ pp_meta.name }}'s own
[custom actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/creating-actions/about-custom-actions),
most notably the [RepoDynamics Action](https://github.com/RepoDynamics/init),
which is entirely powered by our [RepoDynamics Python package](https://github.com/RepoDynamics/RepoDynamics).
