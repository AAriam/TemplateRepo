# TOML

[Tom's Obvious Minimal Language](https://toml.io) (TOML)
is a human-readable configuration file format
with support for hierarchical data structures,
offering an alternative to formats like JSON and [YAML](#bg-yaml).
TOML files, such as Python's [`pyproject.toml`](#bg-pyproject),
are commonly used in software projects
to define configurations in a structured and machine-parsable format.
