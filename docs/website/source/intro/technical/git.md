## Versioneer Auto-version
[Versioneer](https://github.com/warner/python-versioneer) will automatically infer what version 
is installed by looking at the `git` tags and how many commits ahead this version is. The format follows 
[PEP 440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/) and has the regular expression of:
```regexp
\d+.\d+.\d+(?\+\d+-[a-z0-9]+)
```
If the version of this commit is the same as a `git` tag, the installed version is the same as the tag, 
e.g. `{{cookiecutter.repo_name}}-0.1.2`, otherwise it will be appended with `+X` where `X` is the number of commits 
ahead from the last tag, and then `-YYYYYY` where the `Y`'s are replaced with the `git` commit hash.
