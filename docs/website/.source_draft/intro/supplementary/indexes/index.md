biojs.io (https://f1000research.com/articles/3-55/v1; https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/29/8/1103/233057)
and Omic Tools (https://academic.oup.com/database/article/doi/10.1093/database/bau069/2634692)
in the life sciences and DataCite (https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1639998)
