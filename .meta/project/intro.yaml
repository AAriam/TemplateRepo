  - title: Automated Workflows
    description: |
      ${{ name }} fully automates your entire software development process from start to finish,
      using a complete set of fully-configured GitHub Actions workflows,
      professionally designed and implemented according to the latest standards and best practices.

      The following is a simplified example of one of ${{ name }}'s main workflows:

      Every time a new issue is opened in your repository, ${{ name }} automatically
      processes the issue and reformats the text into a pre-defined style,
      to ensure consistency and readability across all issues in your repository.
      It also adds a comment to the issue, which tracks its status,
      and is automatically updated whenever there is a progress.
      Moreover, based on the contents of the issue, it is automatically assigned to a defined maintainer,
      and tagged with various labels that indicate the type and status of the issue,
      along with its target branches and package versions.
      The assigned maintainer can then triage the issue and change its status label accordingly.

      For example, if the issue is labeled as accepted,
      ${{ name }} automatically creates a new development branch from each of the issue's target branches,
      and transforms the issue into draft pull requests for each of the development branches.
      Subsequently, every time changes are applied to one of the development branches,
      ${{ name }} automatically detects the type of changes, and runs the appropriate linting,
      formatting, and testing workflows, applying the necessary fixes and updates to the branch,
      while generating comprehensive reports that can be easily tracked through the draft pull request.
      Furthermore, depending on the type of changes,
      ${{ name }} automatically publishes developmental versions of your package on TestPyPI,
      and generates previews of your documentation website throughout the development process.

      Finally, when a development branch is marked as complete, ${{ name }} automatically
      removes the draft status from the corresponding pull request,
      adds a summary of all applied changes, and requests reviews from the assigned maintainers.
      Once the pull request is approved, the reviewers can label the pull request as final,
      or as a pre-release (alpha, beta, or release candidate)
      in case of pull requests that correspond to a new package version.
      For example, if the pull request is for a new package version and is labeled as final,
      ${{ name }} automatically merges the pull request into the corresponding release branch,
      updates all relevant changelogs, calculates the new version and adds a version tag to the release branch,
      builds the package and publishes it on PyPI, creates a new release on GitHub,
      and generates a new version of the documentation website and deploys it on GitHub Pages,
      with added release notes and an announcement of the new release.

  - title: Centralized Control Center
    description: |
      ${{ name }} provides a centralized control center for your repository,
      where all available settings for ${{ name }} are gathered in one place
      along with all information, configurations, and metadata of your project,
      and thoughtfully organized and presented in a clear, consistent, and concise format,
      mainly through the use of YAML files.
      Whenever you commit changes to the control center files, they are automatically
      applied to your repository, Python package,
      test suite, documentation website, and all other tools and external services.
      Therefore, instead of having to deal with multiple interfaces and diverse configuration
      and metadata files scattered across your repository and each with its own format and syntax,
      you can simply manage your entire project from within the control center,
      using a single, unified, and consistent interface;
      ${{ name }} automatically translates your changes into the appropriate formats,
      generates all necessary files in the required locations, and updates them dynamically.

      The control center contains all key information and metadata of your project,
      such as its name, description, keywords, license and copyright information,
      authors/maintainers and their roles, contact information, citations,
      and branding and styling information, to name a few.
      On top of these, ${{ name }} automatically augments your project's metadata
      with various dynamic information, so that you don't have to manually define and update them.
      For example, all information on your GitHub repository, along with full details of
      the project's owner, authors, maintainers, and contributors, are periodically retrieved
      from GitHub, and a full list of your package's active releases and their corresponding
      information are generated and maintained automatically.

      Furthermore, the control center contains all configurations and metadata for your
      GitHub/Git repository (e.g. general settings; branch protection rules; security configurations;
      GitHub Pages settings; templates for issues, pull requests, and discussions; funding options;
      health files contents; README files contents; description and topics; gitignore and gitattributes files),
      Python package and test suite (e.g. build configurations; package metadata; dependencies
      and other requirements; entry points and scripts declarations; manifest file content;
      docstrings; PyPI and Conda settings),
      documentation website (e.g. menu, navigation bar, and quicklinks items; theme and styling settings;
      custom domain declaration; web analytics settings, announcement configurations),
      and all other tools and external services that are utilized by your project
      (e.g. settings for various linting, formatting, and testing tools such as
      Ruff, Mypy, Pylint, Bandit, Isort, Black, Pytest, Pytest-cov, etc.;
      pre-commit hooks configurations; settings for external platforms such as Codecov and ReadTheDocs).

      In addition, to eliminate any redundancy and provide your project with a high degree of flexibility
      and customization, ${{ name }} allows for complex and recursive templating within all contents of
      the control center, meaning that you can reference and reuse any piece of configuration or data
      in all other parts of the control center.
      You can also command ${{ name }} to dynamically inherit any piece of configuration or data
      from any other GitHub repository, allowing you to easily share and reuse specifications
      across multiple projects.

  - title: Dynamic Content
    description: |
      With the help of the provided control center and its templating capabilities,
      ${{ name }} allows you to make most parts of your repository's contents and interfaces dynamic.
      In addition to all the configuration and metadata files described above,
      the following are a few examples of how this feature is further utilized:

      Issue and discussion forms of your repository (defined in the control center) are completely dynamic.
      For example, they contain dropdown menus for the user to select the package version, Python version,
      operating system, and other specifications relevant to the issue.
      Instead of hard coding these specifications in the forms, which would require you to manually
      update them every time there is a change (e.g. when a new package version is released, or when support
      for a specific Python version or operating system is added or removed),
      ${{ name }} uses its templating mechanism to dynamically reference the corresponding specifications.
      Since these are automatically updated whenever there is a change, this ensures that the forms
      are always up to date, without the need for any manual intervention on your part.

      Similarly, changelogs and release notes, which are automatically generated and updated according
      to the templates defined in the control center, also use a variety of dynamic references,
      such as package version, release date, commit hash, link to the corresponding pull request,
      dependency and requirement changes, list of contributors, and of course, the details of applied changes.
      These are all dynamically obtained from various contexts, so that complete changelog entries and
      release notes can be automatically generated and added to your repository and website
      upon merging a pull request into a release branch.

      Furthermore, all community health files (e.g. contribution guidelines, code of conduct,
      support guidelines, security policy, etc.), license files, and directory README files are also
      dynamically generated and updated according to the templates defined in the control center.
      They include dynamic references to various information defined in your control center,
      such as the name of the project, owner and copyright information, contact information,
      list of maintainers, links to additional information on your website, and so on.
      Therefore, instead of requiring you to manually scan multiple files and update
      the corresponding information whenever there is a change,
      ${{ name }} automatically updates all relevant files whenever any of the referenced information changes.

      In addition, the entire content defined in your control center is also made available
      to your documentation website, allowing you to dynamically reference any piece of information,
      configuration, or metadata of your project in your website's content.
      This allows you to easily maintain a consistent and unified presentation of your project
      across all interfaces and platforms, while eliminating any redundancy and manual intervention.

  - title: Fully Configured
    description: |
      Not only does ${{ name }} come with well-thought-out default configurations for all
      its own options and settings, it also elevates your project by providing a complete set of
      configurations for your repository, Python package, test suite, documentation website,
      and all other tools and external services, according to the latest guidelines and best practices.
      These are automatically applied to your new or existing project when you first start using ${{ name }},
      and are updated dynamically whenever you make changes to the corresponding settings in the control center.

  - title: Highly Customizable
    description: |
      While carefully configured, ${{ name }} is also fully customizable,
      allowing you to tailor every aspect of your development pipeline to your specific needs.

      ${{ name }} also allows you to extend your project's configuration and metadata with
      your own custom specifications, which can then be referenced and utilized anywhere in
      your project, the same way as the built-in contents of the control center.
      For more complex custom specifications that cannot be defined in YAML files,
      or for data that must be generated/retrieved dynamically at runtime
      (e.g. data retrieved from a web API), ${{ name }} allows you to define custom Python scripts
      that are automatically executed during the workflow runs, and whose outputs are then made available
      to your entire project.

  - title: Website Included
    description: |
      ${{ name }} comes with a professional website for your project, that is easily
      customizable, and automatically generated and deployed on your preferred platform.

  - title: Cloud Development
    description: |
      ${{ name }} is a cloud-based solution, that is fully integrated with GitHub,
      and utilizes GitHub Actions to automate your entire software development process.
      This means that you can fully manage your project from within GitHub,
      and that all your project's key information and configuration are stored in your repository,
      and are fully accessible and editable from within GitHub.
      This also means that you can fully manage your project from any device,
      and that you can easily collaborate with other developers on your project,
      without having to install any software or configure any tools on your local machine.

  - title: Plug & Play
    description: |
      With ${{ name }} you are only a few clicks away from releasing your Python package
      on PyPI and GitHub, deploying a complete documentation website, and having a fully configured,
      professional, and dynamic repository up and running, where the only remaining steps in your
      software development process are adding your code, unit-tests and documentation content.

  - title: Self-Contained & Secure
    description: |
      ${{ name }}'s entire infrastructure is natively implemented, self-contained, and highly secure;
      with the exception of a handful of fundamental GitHub Actions and Python libraries from
      official sources such as the Python Packaging Authority and GitHub itself,
      ${{ name }} has no external dependencies, and does not rely on any third-party services.
      Instead, all key features and functionalities of ${{ name }} are implemented natively,
      in a series of open-source GitHub Actions and Python libraries developed and maintained
