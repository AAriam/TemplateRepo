              Before submitting a report, please make sure that you are following our
              <a href="${{url.website.bug_report}}">Bug Report Guidelines</a> to verify that:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The issue you are experiencing is in fact a bug, and not a documented expected behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bug is reproducible in the latest version of the release, and has not yet been reported.

                  This verification process is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.
                  If you are not a collaborator and don't have the time to go through the process,
                  you can always open a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,
                  and convert the discussion into an issue if the bug is verified.

              Before submitting a report, please make sure that you are following our
              <a href="${{url.website.bug_report}}">Bug Report Guidelines</a> to verify that:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  The issue you are experiencing is in fact a bug, and not a documented expected behavior.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The bug is reproducible in the latest version of the release, and has not yet been reported.
                </li>
              </ol>
              
              <blockquote>
                  üí° <a href="${{url.github.discussions.new.question_issues}}"><b>Open a discussion instead!</b></a>
                  <br>
                  This verification process is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.
                  If you are not a collaborator and don't have the time to go through the process,
                  you can always open a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible,
                  and convert the discussion into an issue if the bug is verified.
