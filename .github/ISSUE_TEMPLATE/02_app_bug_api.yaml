        Thank you for taking the time to report a problem in {metadata[project][name]}; 
        we greatly appreciate your contribution! ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè
        
        ## Guidelines
        
        ### üö®‚ÄÇChoosing the right form
        
        <p align="justify">
        Please note that this form is specifically for reporting a <b>non-security-related bug</b> 
        in the {metadata[project][name]} API, i.e. an unexpected behavior that occurs
        while using the application, either as an import package, a command-line tool,
        or via a GUI. 
        
        
        For <b>reporting a security vulnerability</b>, please first read our
        <a href="{metadata[urls][github][security][policy]}">security policy</a>, and then
        fill a <a href="{metadata[urls][github][security][new_advisory]}">private security advisory form</a> 
        instead. 
        For other types of issues, such as 
        <a href="{metadata[urls][github][issues][new][app_bug_setup]}">problems during setup</a>,
        </p>
        
        
        ### ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ÄÇVerifying the bug
        
        Before submitting a report, please verify that:
        
        1. The issue you are experiencing is in fact a bug, 
        and not a documented expected behavior.
        
        2. The bug is reproducible in the latest version of the software, 
        and has not yet been reported.
        
        <blockquote>
            üí° <a href="{}"><b>Open a discussion instead!</b></a>
            <br>
            This verification process is non-trivial, and can be time-consuming.
            If you are not a collaborator and don't have the time to go through the process, 
            you can always open a discussion instead; we will investigate the problem as soon as possible, 
            and convert the discussion into an issue if the bug is verified.
        </blockquote>
