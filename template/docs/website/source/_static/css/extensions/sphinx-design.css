/* Explicitly set the background color.

When an `img-top` is added that does not fill the entire width of the card,
or when the image is transparent, then background of the top part is different
from the card body. We set the top background to the same value as the body here:
*/
.sd-card {
    background-color: var(--pst-color-on-background);
}

/* Change the roundness of cards. */
.sd-card {
    /* 7px is slightly rounder than default. */
    border-radius:7px;
    /* Prevent child elements (sd-card-header, sd-card-body, sd-card-footer)
       from extending beyond the card's borders after changing roundness. */
    overflow: hidden;
}

/* Change the border color of cards on hover. */
.sd-card:hover {
  border-color: var(--pst-color-primary);
}

/* Color of card titles. */
.sd-card-title {
    color: var(--pst-color-primary);
}

/* Distance between cards in a card carousel. */
.sd-cards-carousel .sd-card {
    margin: 0 0 0 10px;
}

/* Prevent magnification when hovering on cards,
   since they overflow from the carousel container and don't look nice. */
.sd-cards-carousel .sd-card:hover {
    transform: none;
}
