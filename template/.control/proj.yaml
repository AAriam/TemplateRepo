  on the homepage of the project's website,
  on the project's PyPI and TestPyPI pages,
  and on the package's main docstring.
  Like all other entries in the repository's control center,
  this text can also contain dynamic references to other entries,
  using the <code>${â€Ž{ json-path.to.value }}</code> syntax.
  By default, the first occurrence of the name of the project
  in this text is styled as strong and linked to the project's website.

  - title: Second Key Feature
