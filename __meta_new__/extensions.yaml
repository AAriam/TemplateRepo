# Meta Content Extensions
# =======================
# This file contains declarations of extended meta contents to be fetched from other GitHub repositories.
# If you do not want to add any extensions, you can delete this file.
#
# Parameters
# ----------
# extensions : array of objects, optional
#    A list of extension declarations, ordered by priority (highest first).
#    Each element of the list must be an object with following keys:
#       type : string
#          Type of the extension.
#       repo : string
#          Full name of the GitHub repository (username/repo-name) to fetch the files from.
#       path : string
#          Path to the file in the repository to fetch.
#       ref : string, default: most recent commit on the default branch
#          The reference (branch, tag, commit etc.) in the repository to fetch the files from.
#          If not provided, the most recent commit on the default branch will be used.
#       append_list : boolean, default: true
#          Whether to append the elements of the lists present in the extended content
#          to the corresponding existing lists present in higher-priority content.
#          If set to `false`, any list that has a corresponding existing list in higher-priority content
#          will be treated as a duplicate (see `raise_duplicate` below).
#       append_dict : boolean, default: true
#          Whether to append the key-value pairs of the dictionaries present in the extended content
#          to the corresponding existing dictionaries present in higher-priority content.
#          If set to `false`, any dictionary that has a corresponding existing dictionary
#          in higher-priority content will be treated as a duplicate (see `raise_duplicate` below).
#       raise_duplicate : boolean, default: false
#          Whether to raise an exception if a list or dictionary in the extended content
#          has a corresponding existing list or dictionary in higher-priority content.
#          If set to `false`, the list or dictionary in the extended content will be ignored.
