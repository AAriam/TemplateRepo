      and time-consuming—especially for novice scientists in this domain. TeachOpenCADD
      is a platform that aims to teach domain-specific skills and to provide pipeline
      templates as starting points for research projects. We offer Python-based solutions
      for common tasks in cheminformatics and structural bioinformatics in the form
      of Jupyter notebooks, based on open source resources only. Including the 12
      newly released additions, TeachOpenCADD now contains 22 notebooks that cover
      both theoretical background as well as hands-on programming. To promote reproducible
      and reusable research, we apply software best practices to our notebooks such
      as testing with automated continuous integration and adhering to the idiomatic
      Python style. The new TeachOpenCADD website is available at https://projects.volkamerlab.org/teachopencadd

    abstract: A series of 2-(perfluoroalkylthio)benzothiazolium (BT-SR<sub>F</sub>)
      salts have been synthesized that serve as convenient sources of hitherto underexplored
      perfluoroalkylthiolate anions. An investigation of their reactivity in a deoxygenative
      nucleophilic substitution reaction led to the development of an unprecedented
      process that provides pentafluoroethyl and heptafluoropropyl thioethers directly
      from readily available alcohols.
